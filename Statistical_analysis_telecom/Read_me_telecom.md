# Detection perspective tariff for a telecom company
There are two tarrif plans to compare. It is necessary to compare the income from each tariff, counting the number of calls made and minutes of conversation spent, to determine how Internet traffic and text messages are spent by month. Then calculate monthly revenue from each user. 
Based on this information, we test hypotheses about the equality of revenue from different tariffs.

The data is presented in five files - general information about customers, data on calls, messages, Internet usage and general information about tariffs.
