We need to check how changing the font in the app will affect the conversion of clicks into purchases. For this purpose, two control (A-A) and one experimental (B) groups were created. 

For each group were defined:
- the number of users who reached the purchase;
- steps where users got "stuck".

After checking the equivalence of the control groups, a comparison with the experimental group followed.
